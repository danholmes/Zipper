in a phunware.com job interview phone-screen yesterday the manager dude described an expert ios
programmer as someone who could do something like make an animated zipper. i started thinking about
how i'd do it while we were still on the phone, kept thinking about it on my daily bike ride, and
came up with this later on that night.

Zipper is a custom UIControl. it's like UISlider, but simpler since i was in a hurry (so its values
always go from 0 to 1 and it has minimal configuration, the images are all hardcoded etc etc.)

it's a control that has a transparent region so you can see what's behind the zipper.

lame but now i know how to sort of subclass uicontrol and draw bezier stuff. i still don't know how
to make nice looking pngs, but i did make an effort. (the teeth are all wrong, but with proper
images they can actually meet perfectly. also i didn't have time to do something really
professional, like shadows. and packaging the thing up in a framework.

it took 5 sheets of paper and a stolen myricom pen, see notes.png. that's sort of proof i didn't
cheat and just find this somewhere (someone probably has done this.)

it is a mix of skeuomorphism and cartoon because i can't draw, but i can steal fabric patterns off
google images.

if i had touched iOS in the last 6 months i would have been faster -- this took from 8 pm to 6 am, i
spent easily 2 hours trying to make the pngs (see the Images subdir), most of the other time was
researching beziers and reading up on uicontrol subclassing and quartz2d stuff i'd forgotten. it's
not a lot of code, a senior ios developer would do it in 2 hours maybe. (and better).

tested on ios 6, just on iphones (not ipads). no idea how to do autorotating anymore on ios5.
